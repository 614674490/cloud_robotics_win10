FACENET MODELS FROM OPENFACE:

openface_nn4.small2.v1.t7
    
    - OpenFace facenet "small model" which generates 128-dim embeddings per face

nn4.v2.t7: 
    - FaceNet "large" model

face_detection_model/

res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel
    - used to detect presence of faces in video
    - SSD: single shot detector model


SVM FACENET MODELS WE CREATE:
see: hardware_experiments/train_facenet_robot_cloud_models/embed_and_train.sh

    {SMALL,LARGE}_CLOUD_SVM:
        - SVM pickled scikit-learn model: recognizer.pickle
        - map from names to numeric labels, such as "bob = 0': le.pickle
        [label encoder]

    SMALL_EDGE_SVM:
        - robot model, analagous to above
